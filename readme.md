- Props: Passing data between components.
- Controlled Components: Managing form input fields and their values.

### Color Palette App

The Color Palette App is a tool for generating color palettes. The following concepts and hooks have been implemented in this task:

- useState: Managing the state of color palettes.
- useEffect: Used for generating random color palettes on component mount.
- Props: Passing data between components.
- Controlled Components: Managing color input fields and their values.
